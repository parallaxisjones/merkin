lightweight client side js library as an exercise and replacement for the jquery stuff I use most often

- AJAX, but using promises and a thenable api complete with PUT and DELETE methodss which jQuery lacks

- A legacy browser safe integrated Event API
 
- DOM selector
 
- Map method

- Extend method

Other various utilities that I find useful.  I will be updating this readme as I work more on this project
